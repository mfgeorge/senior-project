    This repository contains code written for my senior project, in partial fulfillment for a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Cal Poly, SLO. 
    The original works in this repository are licensed under the Modified BSD license and come without warranty, however I am happy to discuss my code with anyone
    interested.

    The hope of releasing this code to the community is to hopefully save someone a bit of leg work in interfacing with an IC-MB4 chip. I do realize that some of my code is application specific, but hopefully the MB4Driver can still be useful.

    This program was eventually ran on an Arduino Uno, then Arduino Nano in the final version of my project. The circuit diagrams detailing how my application was wired 
    is included in this repository, and if you are thinking of using this code for your application, I strongly encourage you to take a look at this diagram. It may save you a headache when you initially wire up the IC-MB4
